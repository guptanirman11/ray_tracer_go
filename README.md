# Ray Tracer in Go

### Project Overview

This project is inspired by the book *Ray Tracer in One Weekend* and aims to extend the concepts covered in subsequent books of the series. The goal is to build a ray tracer from scratch in Go, leveraging synchronization techniques and low-level primitives such as channels and locks to achieve efficient concurrency.
